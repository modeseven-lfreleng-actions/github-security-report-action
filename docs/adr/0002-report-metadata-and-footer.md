## Context

The report renders across four surfaces — Rich terminal, Slack mrkdwn, Markdown
(the canonical artifact and GitHub job summary), and HTML (GitHub Pages). Each
surface had grown its own copy of the per-category heading text, the under-table
summary wording, the "clean"/"not enabled"/"unknown" footnotes, and the
explanatory notes. The same conceptual line was phrased differently on each
surface ("✅ 86 repositories clean" vs "86 enabled" vs "All in-scope
repositories have this feature enabled."), some categories duplicated a count
that was already stated ("All enabled" *and* "86 enabled"), and the section
descriptions were either hard-coded per surface or absent for several
categories. Adding a category, renaming a label, or changing the footer ordering
meant editing four renderers and their tests in lockstep, and it was easy for
them to drift.

## Decision

1. **A single category registry.** `categories.py` holds a `CategoryMeta` for
   each of the ten reporting categories: stable `key` (also the future config
   key), display `title`, `pass_label`, `fail_label`, documentation `url`, and a
   default `description`. The registry imports nothing from the rest of the
   package, so both the domain models and the renderers depend on it without a
   cycle. Renderers no longer hard-code headings, labels or explanatory text.

2. **One footer builder for every surface.** `report.build_summary()` turns a
   category's normalised count buckets (fail / disabled / unknown / pass /
   excluded) into ordered, formatted `SummaryLine`s. Every surface renders those
   lines, so wording and ordering are identical everywhere. Ordering is
   remediation-first: failures and disabled at the top, then unknown, then the
   healthy pass line, then excluded — this tool drives remediation, so the work
   to do sits at the top.

3. **The "All <pass>" collapse.** The pass line reads `All <pass_label>` (no
   number) only when no other bucket needs attention; otherwise every present
   bucket shows its count. This replaces the previous mix of "All enabled" plus
   a redundant numeric count.

4. **Descriptions are a rich-surface affordance.** The per-category description
   and its documentation link render only on Markdown and HTML, where there is
   room to scroll. The terminal and Slack stay brevity-first (Slack is for
   incident response, where superfluous text is noise).

5. **Per-category exclusions, no org banner.** Excluded repositories are surfaced
   in each category's footer (a counted `⏩` line plus a named breakdown) rather
   than a single org-level banner, so the exclusion is visible in the context of
   every category it affects.

6. **Pass/fail cutoff in the metadata.** `CategoryMeta` carries a
   `fail_severity` cutoff for the severity-ranked signals, and severity gains an
   `informational` rung below `low` (where SARIF `note`/`none` findings
   normalise). A repository is an offender only when it has a finding at or
   above the cutoff; sub-threshold findings fold into the clean count. The
   global default is `medium`; Zizmor lowers it to `low`. The cutoff is
   overridable per category via `report.categories.<key>.fail_severity`, so the
   "what counts as a failure" decision lives in the same metadata-driven place
   as the labels and descriptions.

## Consequences

- A wording, label, URL or ordering change is made once in the registry or
  `build_summary()` and flows to all four surfaces.
- The `TableSection` model carries `CategoryMeta` plus normalised
  pass/fail/unknown counts instead of pre-rendered `note`/`summary`/`empty_note`
  strings; the old per-surface note-splitting helper is gone.
- Category `key` values are part of the configuration contract: they name the
  per-category and per-output render toggles (`report.categories.<key>` with an
  `enabled` switch and a per-surface `outputs` map), so they must be renamed with
  care.
- The Dependabot enablement table is titled **"Dependabot: Alerts Enabled"** to
  disambiguate it from the **"Dependabot: Security Alerts"** open-alert signal it
  nests beneath.

## Amendment (2026-07-07)

Point 6 originally normalised SARIF `note`/`none` findings to the
`informational` rung. This under-stated the estate's zizmor posture:
zizmor's SARIF encoder emits both its Low and Informational findings at
level `note`, and the organisation scan pipeline runs zizmor with
`--min-severity low`, so informational findings never reach the uploaded
SARIF -- every `note` code-scanning alert is a genuine Low finding. The
ruleset-enforced PR gate blocks on note-and-above, so the report showed
repositories as clean that the gate was failing. SARIF `note` now
normalises to `low` (only `none` and unclassifiable alerts land at
`informational`); with Zizmor's `low` cutoff, any zizmor finding makes a
repository an offender, matching the gate.
