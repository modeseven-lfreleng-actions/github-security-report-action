# Design Brief: GitHub Security Report Action

> Status: **Pre-implementation design brief.** Captures the outcome of a
> structured Q&A (grilling) session. This document is the authoritative source
> of intent until superseded by a `CONTEXT.md` + ADRs. It records *what* and
> *why*; implementation details (the *how*) follow during build.

## 1. Purpose and framing

A **reporting** (not scanning) GitHub Action and Python CLI that aggregates
existing security and code-quality signals across one or more GitHub
organisations and presents them for **remediation triage** — surfacing the
worst offenders so resources can be directed where they are most needed.

- Implemented as a **Python CLI** (Typer) with a **thin `action.yaml`** that
  maps inputs to CLI flags/args.
- Published to **PyPI**; executed via **`uvx`**; a **uv project** with a
  committed `uv.lock`.
- Borrows mechanisms from sibling repos:
  - `project-reporting-tool` — scheduled run, GitHub Pages publishing,
    Simple-DataTables HTML, Slack delivery via third-party action,
    base64 config-in-secret pattern, `concurrency/` async shape, `syrupy`
    snapshot tests.
  - `.github` — single-org `gh api` scan + code-fenced Slack block message,
    per-org `excluded-repos.json` exclusion pattern.
  - `dependamerge` — **canonical** Python CI/release workflows
    (`build-test.yaml`, `build-test-release.yaml`) built from
    `lfreleng-actions/python-*` composite actions, `hatch-vcs` versioning.

## 2. Naming (locked)

| Identifier | Value |
|---|---|
| Repository / action | `github-security-report-action` |
| PyPI distribution | `github-security-report` (verified available on PyPI) |
| CLI command | `github-security-report` |

## 3. Phase 0 — capability spike (gates all design)

The design is **gated** behind a throwaway API spike, because the target
signals live behind very different APIs with different access models and
maturity. Phase 0 must, before schema/column design is finalised:

- Hit the real `lfreleng-actions` estate and produce a **capability matrix**
  per signal: available? / which API (REST vs GraphQL vs external) / which
  token scope / sample response shape / org-bulk vs per-repo / observed HTTP
  status codes for enabled-clean vs disabled vs insufficient-permission.
- Confirm which **org-bulk** endpoints actually return data for our token tier.
- Capture **scrubbed** real response shapes — these become the **golden test
  fixtures** (no sensitive data; no live API in CI).

Transport is therefore **hybrid REST + GraphQL** (GraphQL-only is not viable —
secret scanning and code scanning are REST).

## 4. Report scope (v1)

**Five ranked tables**, each using the four-state model (§6), plus a boolean
**posture/coverage** section feeding nag lists:

| Signal | Transport | Metric |
|---|---|---|
| Code scanning alerts (CodeQL) | REST (org-bulk preferred), filtered `tool.name == "CodeQL"` | severity counts |
| OpenSSF Scorecard | external API score (where covered) + code-scanning `tool.name == "Scorecard"` | score (inverted) / finding severity |
| zizmor (GHA workflow linter) | code-scanning `tool.name == "zizmor"` | severity counts (`severity` error/warning) |
| Dependabot alerts | GraphQL + REST org-bulk | severity counts |
| Secret scanning alerts | REST (org-bulk preferred) | open count |

> **Phase 0 findings:** the single code-scanning sweep multiplexes **three**
> tools (`CodeQL`, `Scorecard`, `zizmor`) and must be **partitioned by
> `tool.name`** — each feeds its own table, and per-tool filtering of counts is
> mandatory (e.g. a repo with code-scanning alerts that are all Scorecard is
> CodeQL-clean). zizmor was the largest contributor in our estate and is now a
> first-class v1 table. Scorecard prefers the external `securityscorecards.dev`
> aggregate score where the repo is covered and falls back to code-scanning
> Scorecard findings otherwise. See [`docs/phase0-findings.md`](phase0-findings.md).

Posture booleans (no ranking, feed coverage/nag): Security policy, Private
vulnerability reporting, Security advisories, etc.

**Resilience:** every section is **best-effort and independently degradable** —
an unavailable signal/API renders "no data available" and **never fails the
whole run**.

### Deferred

- **GitHub Code Quality (preview)** — Maintainability / Reliability / AI
  Suggestions. **No documented public API** at time of writing. Requirement is
  captured here and deferred until a mature API surfaces. When available, report
  the three categories as separate columns/sub-reports. Language support
  (C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, TypeScript) would later be detected
  from repository metadata to decide whether a repo *should* have it enabled.

### Extra reporting categories (configuration posture & freshness)

Beyond the five ranked signals, two further categories report **configuration
posture** and **freshness**. They sit outside the four-state model and render as
plain tables (no offender/clean/nag/unknown classification).

**Dependabot** (sub-tables nested beneath the Dependabot Alerts heading):

- **Enablement** — repositories where Dependabot alerts are *not* switched on
  (the GraphQL `hasVulnerabilityAlertsEnabled` read). This replaces the
  Dependabot signal's nag list so the same repositories are not listed twice.
- **Update Cooldown** — repositories/ecosystems whose `.github/dependabot.yml`
  declares an `updates` entry with **no `cooldown`**. A cooldown is a mandatory
  requirement; **any** cooldown value passes. Repositories with no Dependabot
  configuration are not listed.
- **Feature Configuration** — a matrix of repo-level Dependabot features, one
  column per feature (✅/❌/❓). Rows are ranked by the number of
  confirmed-disabled features (unknowns do not count), worst first; that count
  is a **hidden sort key and is never shown as a column** — the disabled cells
  already make it visible. Only features with a public per-repository API are
  checked: **Dependabot alerts** (`hasVulnerabilityAlertsEnabled`) and
  **Security updates** (`GET /repos/{o}/{r}/automated-security-fixes`).
  **Dependabot malware alerts** and **Grouped security updates** are
  intentionally omitted — GitHub exposes no public per-repository API for them
  at time of writing.

**Releases / Tagging** (top-level section): repositories that have gone too long
without a release or tag. Releases (`GET /repos/{o}/{r}/releases/latest`) and
tags (GraphQL `refs(refPrefix: "refs/tags/", orderBy: TAG_COMMIT_DATE)`) are
reported in **two separate columns** as a human "last release / last tag" age.

- **Age hold:** repositories created within `report.release_min_age_days` days
  (default **28**, CLI `--release-min-age-days`) are excluded; **0** disables
  the hold so every repository is included.
- **On-demand exclusions:** `releases_exclude` (per org; CLI `--releases-exclude`,
  repeatable) drops repositories that are never released / not consumed
  externally.
- **Hidden compound sort score (never displayed):** rows rank by
  `release_staleness_days + tag_staleness_days`. A **missing** release or tag
  contributes the repository's **full age**, so a repository with **neither** a
  release nor a tag effectively counts its age **twice** and ranks highest. The
  two columns show the individual staleness; the compound value is used only for
  ordering and is deliberately not rendered. Probes are skipped for excluded /
  too-young repositories (they cannot appear in the table anyway), saving two
  HTTP calls each.

## 5. Metrics, ranking and columns

- **Per-report-type metric definitions** — no single universal "issue count".
  Each report declares `(value, sort_direction)`.
- **Severity-weighted where available; fall back to flat count** otherwise.
- When severity data exists, show **separate columns** (critical / high /
  medium / low).
- **Row sort:** hierarchical, worst-first — critical desc → high desc →
  medium desc → low desc. Scorecard sorts by score **ascending** (lowest =
  worst = top).

## 6. Four-state model (per report type, per repo)

Each in-scope repo falls into exactly one bucket **per report type** (not
global):

1. **Enabled + has open findings** → table row (sorted worst-first).
2. **Enabled + zero findings** → omitted from table; counted in a
   "✅ N repositories clean" summary beneath the table.
3. **Supported but NOT enabled** → bulleted **nag list** beneath the table
   (excludes archived/test repos).
4. **Unknown / insufficient permission** (indeterminate probe: missing scope,
   GHAS not licensed, ambiguous 403/404) → **footnoted count**; never merged
   into clean or nag.

**Enabled-probe contract** (each signal declares its own probe; Phase 0 locks
exact rules):

- CodeQL → **presence of `code-scanning/analyses?tool_name=CodeQL`** (the
  authoritative probe). `default-setup` is **insufficient**: Phase 0 found
  `not-configured` repos that still carry code-scanning alerts from other
  tools, and the `dependamerge` fork runs CodeQL via advanced setup with
  `default-setup` off. Code scanning **entirely disabled** → `404` on both
  `/alerts` and `/analyses` (vs `200 []` = enabled-clean).
- Scorecard / zizmor → presence of their respective `tool.name` analyses /
  workflow. Counts for every code-scanning-derived table are **filtered by
  `tool.name`** — a repo whose code-scanning alerts are all Scorecard is
  CodeQL-clean.
- **Workflow-driven tools enforced by an org ruleset** (e.g. zizmor) are also
  enabled via that ruleset, not only a per-repo file. A repo is enabled when an
  **active** org ruleset has a `workflows` rule whose required-workflow path
  matches the tool (keyword, configurable via `report.ruleset_workflows`,
  default `{"zizmor": "zizmor"}`) **and** the repo matches the ruleset's
  `repository_name` targeting. Org mode reads `GET /orgs/{org}/rulesets`; repo
  mode reads the repo's effective `GET .../rules/branches/{branch}`. If the
  token cannot read rulesets (403), coverage degrades to per-repo evidence.
  This prevents falsely nagging the many repos whose zizmor scan runs from the
  central `.github/workflows/zizmor.yaml` ruleset.
- Secret scanning → **404 on alerts = disabled** (confirmed on the fork org)
  vs `[]` = enabled-clean.
- Dependabot → `hasVulnerabilityAlertsEnabled` (`false` = disabled, confirmed
  on the fork org) / 403 = insufficient permission.

**Status-code mapping** (owning PAT): `404` = disabled → nag; `403` =
insufficient permission / GHAS unlicensed → unknown bucket; `200`+data =
offender; `200`+empty = clean.

## 7. Repository scope and exclusions

Default in-scope: **non-archived, non-fork, non-template, sources only**,
public and private (visibility follows the token; external consumers
considered even though our own org has few/no private repos). Empty/disabled
repos auto-skipped.

- **Per-org `exclude` list** — optional (mirrors `.github/excluded-repos.json`);
  omitted in the minimal config and defaults to empty. Excluded repositories are
  removed from analysis but **surfaced as "excluded"** (counted and listed once
  per org, on every render surface), so an explicit exclusion is visible and
  clearly distinct from a "not enabled" nag rather than silently dropped.
- **Archived** — fully excluded by default; opt back in via config option +
  CLI flag.
- **Test repos** — excluded by default; opt back in via `--include-test`.
  Matched as a **delimited token** (`test`/`tests` as a segment after splitting
  on `-`, `_`, `.`, `/`) — **not** a raw substring (so `latest`, `attestation`,
  `contest` are NOT excluded).
- **Archived and test repos never appear in nag lists / notifications.**
- **All exclusions are logged with their reason** (INFO) — never silent.

## 8. Configuration

Sourced from a CLI-supplied JSON file **or** a GitHub secret/variable.

- **Variable vs secret applies only to the config JSON**, not the credential:
  plain `vars.` entry when the JSON holds no secrets (single org); **base64**
  in a `secrets.` entry when wrapping is wanted. Base64 is used because raw
  JSON braces trip GitHub's log-redaction and mangle tool output (encoding,
  not encryption).
- **Token is referenced by env-var name** (`token_env`), resolved at runtime.
  Literal tokens are permitted but **discouraged (warn)**.
- **Structure:** global defaults + per-org overrides.
- **Validated** against a `jsonschema`.
- `report_day` accepts: a single weekday (default `tuesday`), a list of days,
  `"never"`, or `"always"`.

Sketch:

```json
{
  "slack": { "channel": "releng-scm", "report_day": "tuesday" },
  "report": {
    "top_n": 10,
    "include_archived": false,
    "include_test": false,
    "release_min_age_days": 28
  },
  "organizations": [
    {
      "name": "lfreleng-actions",
      "token_env": "SECURITY_REPORT_PAT",
      "exclude": ["actions-template"],
      "releases_exclude": ["internal-only-repo"]
    }
  ]
}
```

- `report.release_min_age_days` (default `28`, `0` = include all) and the per-org
  `releases_exclude` control the Releases / Tagging section (§4). Both can be
  overridden at the CLI with `--release-min-age-days` and the repeatable
  `--releases-exclude`.
- **Config source precedence (CLI):** `--config` file > `--config-data`
  (raw/base64) > `--org` shorthand > a per-user config file at
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/github-security-report/config.json` (falling back to
  `~/.config/...`). The per-user file makes a flagless local run resolve to org
  mode instead of erroring; the action never reads it (configuration is passed
  explicitly). Secrets stay out of the file — the token is referenced by
  `token_env`, and the Slack bot token is a workflow-only secret.

## 9. Credentials and operating modes

- **Org-wide security data requires a classic PAT** (`security_events`, `repo`,
  `read:org`). The ephemeral `GITHUB_TOKEN` is **repo-scoped** and is 403/404'd
  on org-level security endpoints; fine-grained tokens can't span orgs. The
  token is therefore **always a PAT secret** referenced by `token_env` for org
  mode.
- **`scope` input: `auto | org | repo`.**
  - **Org mode** — PAT + config; org-bulk endpoints; multi-org; Pages + Slack.
  - **Repo mode** — degraded, self-contained: uses the ephemeral
    `GITHUB_TOKEN` for the **current repo's own** data only (`security-events:
    read`). A drop-in others add to a single repo. **No HTML/Pages, no Slack.**
    Output = tidy `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` + action **outputs** (per-signal
    counts) + a configurable **fail-threshold** input (e.g. fail on any open
    critical) so it works as a **PR gate**.
  - **`auto`** resolves to `repo` when no PAT/config is supplied, `org` when
    they are. The resolved mode is **logged loudly** and surfaced in the
    summary — never silent.
- **Mode precedence:** explicit `--scope` flag > PAT/config presence >
  git-remote auto-detect > clear error.

## 10. Local CLI / developer experience

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` sourced from the **shell environment** for local runs.
- When CWD is a Git repo, detect the GitHub repo from remotes —
  **`upstream` preferred, `origin` fallback** — and default to **repo mode**
  for that repo. Handle both `git@github.com:org/repo.git` and
  `https://github.com/org/repo(.git)` forms; strip `.git`; ignore
  non-`github.com` remotes (graceful fallback / clear error if none qualify).
- **Rich** terminal rendering (tables, severity colour) is the **default on a
  TTY**; in CI / non-TTY / `--no-color` / `CI=true`, fall back to plain output.
- Local **org** runs (export an org PAT + `--scope org`) render the same ranked
  tables in the terminal via Rich (no Pages/Slack needed locally).

## 11. Output targets

Four presentation surfaces from one canonical dataset:

1. **GitHub Pages (canonical, org mode)** — full results, every category, no
   top-N truncation. `gh-pages/<org-slug>/report.{html,md,json}` +
   `metadata.json`; generated root `index.html` card-grid landing page
   (reuse `project-reporting-tool`'s gradient style/CSS), one card per org.
   Per-org `report.html` is a **single scrollable page** with all sections.
   Index generation is **owned by the Python tool** (Jinja2), not a bash
   script. The main `README.md` carries a prominent Pages link near the top.
   HTML tables use **Simple-DataTables** (sortable + searchable + pagination),
   reusing `project-reporting-tool`'s macro approach. *(Refinement: pin the CDN
   version + add SRI instead of `@latest` — security tool should not load an
   unpinned CDN asset.)*
2. **Slack (org mode, gated)** — delivered via the same third-party action
   (`slackapi/slack-github-action`) to `vars.SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` (channel
   `releng-scm`). Slack **cannot render Markdown tables**, so the message is a
   **code-fenced (monospace) top-N (10) block** per report type **plus a
   prominent link** to the GitHub Pages report. Top-N (10) applies **only to
   Slack**.
3. **Job summary (repo mode)** — tidy `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` + action outputs.
4. **Rich terminal (local)** — see §10.

## 12. Scheduling and Slack gating

- Single `reporting.yaml`: `cron: '0 9 * * *'` (**daily 09:00 UTC**) +
  `workflow_dispatch` with a `force_notify` boolean for off-schedule Slack
  testing.
- **Pages refreshed daily** (remediation progress visible day-to-day).
- **Slack gated to `report_day`** (default Tuesday). The **tool** owns the
  day logic: it parses `report_day` and emits a `should_notify` output; the
  workflow's Slack step is a dumb `if: should_notify == 'true'` gate (logic
  lives in one tested place, not duplicated in YAML).

## 13. Bulk-query strategy, rate limits, concurrency

- **Org-bulk-first, per-repo fallback.** Prefer `GET /orgs/{org}/...` bulk
  alert endpoints (one paginated sweep per signal per org, `repository`
  attached); per-repo calls only when bulk is unavailable.
- **GraphQL batching** (aliased multi-repo, paginated) for repo metadata +
  Dependabot.
- **`httpx` with bounded async concurrency** (configurable, conservative
  default ~4–8) + **exponential backoff honoring `Retry-After` and secondary
  rate-limit** signals; respect `x-ratelimit-remaining`; surface budget in
  logs. Borrow `project-reporting-tool`'s `concurrency/` shape.

## 14. Distribution, CI and release

- **CI/release baseline adopted from `dependamerge` verbatim:**
  `build-test.yaml` (PR: `python-build-action` → `python-test-action` matrix →
  `python-audit-action` → SBOM → grype, all behind `harden-runner-block-action`,
  SHA-pinned) and `build-test-release.yaml` (tag → PyPI trusted publishing).
  `hatch-vcs` dynamic version; `uv.lock` committed.
- **Action runtime hybrid:** `action.yaml` **auto-detects** run source —
  `local` when `github.event_name == 'pull_request'` (`uvx --from
  "${GITHUB_ACTION_PATH}"` so PRs exercise unreleased code), otherwise `pypi`
  with a pinned `tool_version`
  (`uvx --from github-security-report==<version> github-security-report ...`).
  Harden-runner egress must allow `pypi.org` / `files.pythonhosted.org` for the
  `pypi` path and the GitHub API for both.

## 15. Dependabot

`.github/dependabot.yml`, two ecosystems (`github-actions`, `uv`):

- weekly interval, **7-day cooldown**, **15** open-PR limit, `Chore` commit
  prefix (matches the standard sibling config).

## 16. Testing strategy

- **No live API in CI.** Unit tests over pure functions (severity ranking,
  four-state classification, sort order, Markdown/Slack/HTML/Rich rendering,
  config schema validation, exclusion logic) fed by **scrubbed Phase 0 fixture
  JSON**.
- **Transport tests** via `respx` (httpx mock) / recorded cassettes for
  pagination, backoff, 404-as-disabled behaviour.
- **`syrupy` snapshots** for rendered Markdown/HTML (as in
  `project-reporting-tool`).
- Phase 0 scrubbed captures **are** the golden fixture corpus.

## 17. Open items for Phase 0 to resolve

First spike run recorded in [`docs/phase0-findings.md`](phase0-findings.md).

- ✅ Org-bulk endpoints available for our PAT tier (all `200`); org-bulk-first
  validated.
- ✅ Scorecard data source resolved: external `securityscorecards.dev`
  aggregate score where the repo is covered (4/5 demanding repos), falling back
  to code-scanning Scorecard findings; nag where neither exists.
- ✅ Code scanning multiplexes `CodeQL` + `Scorecard` + `zizmor`; partition by
  `tool.name` confirmed mandatory; **zizmor promoted to a fifth v1 table**.
- ✅ Severity ranking keys confirmed (`security_severity_level` primary,
  `severity` fallback exercised by zizmor).
- ✅ CodeQL enabled-probe resolved: **CodeQL analyses presence** (not
  `default-setup`), with per-tool alert filtering. Fork org confirmed CodeQL
  via advanced setup (`default-setup=not-configured` + analyses present).
- ✅ All four-state status semantics confirmed via the
  `modeseven-lfreleng-actions` fork org: secret scanning `404` = disabled,
  Dependabot `false` = disabled, code scanning disabled → `404` on alerts +
  analyses. `403` reserved for the unknown/insufficient-permission bucket.
- ⏳ Confirm Code Quality remains API-less (keep deferred).

## 18. Decision log (this session)

1. Phase 0 capability spike gates the design; transport is hybrid REST+GraphQL.
2. Code Quality deferred (no public API) — captured, not built.
3. Per-report metric definitions; severity-weighted where available, else count.
4. Separate severity columns; rows sorted critical→high→medium→low desc.
5. Scope = non-archived/non-fork/non-template/sources; public+private.
6. Optional per-org exclude list (defaults to empty); archived opt-in; test opt-in.
7. `test` matched as delimited token, not substring; exclusions logged.
8. Config: token by env-var name; global+per-org; jsonschema; flexible
   `report_day`.
9. Slack = code-fenced top-N + Pages link; tool owns `should_notify` gating.
10. Top-N (10) is Slack-only; Pages shows full results.
11. Four-state model (offenders / clean count / nag / unknown).
12. Pages = `gh-pages/<org>/...` + Jinja2 card index; single scrollable page;
    Simple-DataTables.
13. Action runtime: auto `local` on PR, else pinned PyPI via `uvx`.
14. Adopt `dependamerge` CI/release verbatim.
15. v1 = 5 ranked tables (CodeQL, Scorecard, zizmor, Dependabot, secret
    scanning) + boolean posture; best-effort degradation.
16. Daily 09:00 UTC cron; Pages daily; Slack on `report_day`; `force_notify`.
17. Enabled-probe contract per signal; fourth unknown/insufficient bucket.
18. Org-bulk-first + per-repo fallback; bounded async + backoff; classic PAT.
19. Token always a PAT for org mode; default `GITHUB_TOKEN` insufficient.
20. `scope: auto|org|repo`; repo mode = summary + outputs + fail-threshold,
    no Pages/Slack.
21. PyPI + CLI name `github-security-report` (available).
22. Local: shell `GITHUB_TOKEN`; git-remote detect (`upstream`→`origin`);
    Rich terminal output, plain fallback in CI.
23. Tests: fixtures + `respx` + `syrupy`, no live API; Phase 0 captures =
    golden fixtures.
