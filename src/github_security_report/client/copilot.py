"""Reading outstanding Copilot review feedback from a pull-request node.

One question, asked of the ``reviewThreads`` connection the batched prefetch
requests: is this pull request still waiting on a human to answer GitHub's
automated code reviewer? Kept apart from the general node parsing because it is
the only reading that has to reason about a *nested* bounded window, and so
about what the window's edge does and does not prove.

    """Whether the pull request has unresolved Copilot review feedback.

    ``True`` when a review thread opened by GitHub's automated code reviewer is
    still unresolved. ``False`` only when the collected window covered *every*
    thread and none of them qualified, so the answer is complete.

    ``None`` is the indeterminate case, and covers three readings that must not
    be presented as "nothing outstanding": review threads that could not be read
    at all; a pull request carrying more threads than the window returned with
    no qualifying thread among the ones it did -- an unresolved thread may sit
    in those never collected; and a ``totalCount`` that is absent or unusable,
    which leaves the window's coverage unproven and so cannot establish that
    every thread was seen. This mirrors the rule ``mergeable`` and the check
    rollup already follow: not established is not the same as nothing to report.

    The window holds the *newest* threads (see ``_REVIEW_THREAD_WINDOW``), which
    is what makes ``True`` reachable on a long review: unanswered feedback is
    the recent kind, so a truncated window that finds nothing is a weak reading
    rather than the usual one.

    An outdated thread still counts. GitHub marks a thread outdated when the
    code beneath it changes but does not resolve it, so the feedback remains
    unanswered -- which is exactly what the column reports.
