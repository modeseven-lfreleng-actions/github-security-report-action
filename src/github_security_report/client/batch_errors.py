"""Reading the ``errors`` array of a batched GraphQL query.

GitHub answers a partially-failed aliased query with HTTP 200: the readable
aliases populated, the rest ``null`` or missing individual fields, and an
``errors`` array explaining why. Deciding what those entries mean for each
repository -- unreadable, unreadable in one isolable field, or a symptom of the
whole batch being too large -- is a policy of its own, kept here so the client
that issues the query stays about issuing it.

    Raises :class:`GraphBatchError` when the query failed as a whole -- for
    every one of the ``count`` repositories -- and says whether the caller may
    retry them in smaller batches. Four shapes are told apart, in this order:

    * A non-200 ``status`` (``body`` is then ``None``): a 502 or 504 is
      GitHub's edge giving up on a query that ran too long, which a smaller
      batch may avoid; any other status -- a 403/429 that outlived the
      transport's retry budget, or a 500/503 outage -- would recur at any size.
    * ``RATE_LIMITED`` or ``RATE_LIMIT`` in ``errors``: a GraphQL rate limit
      (hourly points or the secondary burst limit) is spent, so a retry in any
      batch size would only burn requests against it.
    * "Resource limits exceeded" in ``errors``: GitHub ran out of execution
      budget part-way through and nulled the rest. Those nulls are a symptom of
      the batch's size, not per-repository read failures, so the batch is
      failed for splitting rather than (typically most of) it marked unknown.
    * No ``data`` object at all: with the rate limit ruled out, this is how
      GitHub reports a query it could not finish in time.

    Anything else is a response the caller can read alias by alias; a missing
    or malformed ``errors`` array is returned as an empty list.

    Each message ends with the remedy that fits the failure: a batch of
    several repositories can be retried smaller, but by the time a failure
    escapes the adaptive collector the batch is usually a single repository,
    and advising a smaller batch then would be advice that cannot be followed;
    a permission error was never retried, so it must not claim a retry budget
    was spent.

    Returns ``(unreadable, pull_requests_only)``: aliases that must be failed
    wholesale, and aliases whose only failures were confined to fields in
    :data:`_ISOLABLE_FIELDS`.

    GitHub reports a *field-level* failure with HTTP 200: the alias is still a
    populated dictionary, the field that failed is null, and an ``errors``
    entry carries its path (e.g. ``["r3", "latestRelease"]``). Parsing such a
    node would convert a read failure into a confident negative -- a nulled
    ``latestRelease`` is indistinguishable from "never released" -- so the
    whole alias is treated as unreadable rather than partially trusted.

    The alias is failed wholesale rather than per field, because a per-field
    flag would have to be threaded through every table to be honest about which
    half of a row is trustworthy, whereas one unknown repository is already a
    state every table renders correctly. The exception is a field the model
    *already* carries a dedicated unknown for: failing the whole repository for
    one of those would let an optional, permission-sensitive section take the
    rest of the report down with it -- a token without pull-request access would
    lose its releases, issues and Dependabot posture too.

    An error whose path names no alias cannot be attributed, so it implicates
    every alias in the batch: with no way to tell which repositories it
    touched, treating any of them as successfully read would be a guess.

    An error *nested* inside an isolable field is classified by that field, and
    deliberately so. ``reviewThreads`` is non-null in GitHub's schema
    (``PullRequestReviewThreadConnection!``), so a resolver failure there does
    not null the connection: it propagates up to the nearest nullable ancestor,
    which is the pull-request node itself. The node arrives as ``null`` and
    carries none of its facts, so ignoring the error would silently drop that
    pull request from every column while ``totalCount`` still counted it --
    understating the breakdown with nothing to say so. Failing the connection
    reports the repository as unknown instead, which every table renders
    correctly.
