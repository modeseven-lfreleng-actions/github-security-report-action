"""The org-bulk alert sweeps, and the two-pass secret-scanning read.

:class:`AlertReads` owns the alert reads shared across scopes: one org-bulk
sweep per signal family, and the secret-scanning read that both the org sweep
and the per-repository probe route through.

Secret scanning needs that shared implementation because GitHub's alerts
endpoints return only its *default* provider patterns unless ``secret_type``
names something else, and answer ``200 []`` -- not an error -- for anything
they were not asked about. A single, unfiltered sweep therefore reports a
repository leaking a private key or a password as clean, and no downstream
status handling can tell that empty result from a genuine one. The sweep is
issued twice instead, once unfiltered and once naming the patterns GitHub
leaves out, and the two are merged. The org-bulk and per-repo alert endpoints
take the same parameters, so one implementation covers both scopes.

See :mod:`github_security_report.secret_patterns` for the pattern vocabulary
and why the list has to be checked at runtime.

    The two halves answer two different questions, and collapsing them into one

    ``endpoint_status`` answers "is secret scanning on, and readable here?"
    (404 = disabled, 403 = forbidden). A 200 from *either* half settles it,
    because both halves call the same endpoint with the same credentials, and
    so does holding any alert at all: an alert can only have come out of a 200
    response body, whatever status the read finished on. Only when neither
    half answered and neither collected anything is the unfiltered half's
    status reported, being the plain read's own verdict.

    ``read_status`` answers "was the alert list complete?" and is non-200 when
    either half failed, so a partial sweep can never be reported as clean.

    Repository scope needs them apart. It has no separate enablement probe, so
    one status previously did both jobs -- and a forbidden second half would
    then classify a repository whose *first* half returned alerts as UNKNOWN

        GitHub answers an unrecognised ``secret_type`` with ``200 []`` rather

        back to the bug the second pass exists to fix -- silently. This check is
        the only thing standing between that hardcoded list and a false "clean".

        Strictly best-effort: a classic PAT reads the inventory with the
        ``read:org`` scope the tool already requires, but a fine-grained token
        needs an optional organisation permission, and ``owner`` may be a user
        account rather than an organisation, so an unreadable check passes
        without comment. Only a *readable* inventory that disowns one of the
        slugs warns. The AI-detected patterns are absent from that inventory
        and go unchecked; see :mod:`github_security_report.secret_patterns`.

        Best-effort includes the transport and the payload: an optional check
        must not be able to abort a run whose real reads would have succeeded,
        so a timeout, a connection failure, or a body that is not valid JSON is
        swallowed and the list used unverified. The read is issued ``quiet``
        for the same reason -- its retry notices drop to DEBUG, so a probe
        nothing depends on cannot fill a healthy run's output with warnings.
        Rejected credentials still abort, because every subsequent read would
