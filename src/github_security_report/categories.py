"""Report category metadata.

A single, render-surface-agnostic registry describing every reporting category
the tool produces. Each category carries its display title, the pass/fail
vocabulary used in the standardised summary footer, a documentation URL, and a
default human description. Renderers read this registry instead of hard-coding
per-category headings, labels and explanatory text, so a wording change here
flows to the terminal, Slack, Markdown and HTML surfaces at once.

The registry deliberately holds no behaviour and imports nothing from the rest
of the package except the leaf ``severity`` and ``secret_patterns`` modules
(which themselves import nothing from the package), so both the domain models
and the renderers can depend on it without a cycle. ``key`` values are the
stable identifiers used by the per-category configuration toggles, so treat
them as part of the config contract: rename with care.
