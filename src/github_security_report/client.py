"""Async GitHub transport: hybrid REST + GraphQL.

Implements the Phase 0 strategy: prefer org-bulk alert sweeps, fall back to
per-repo enabled-probes, with bounded concurrency and backoff that honours
``Retry-After`` and secondary rate limits. Methods return raw parsed JSON (and
HTTP status where the status itself is the signal, e.g. 404 = feature disabled).
