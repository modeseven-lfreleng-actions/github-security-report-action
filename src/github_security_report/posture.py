"""Dependabot configuration posture and release/tag staleness.

These reporting categories sit outside the four-state per-signal model: they are
configuration-posture and freshness checks rendered as plain tables.

- **Dependabot** (beneath the open-alert table): three plain tables -- repos
  with vulnerability **alerts** not enabled, repos with **security updates** not
  enabled (two separate single-feature tables, not a combined matrix), and
  configured ecosystems that set no update *cooldown* (a mandatory requirement
  here -- any cooldown value passes). Only the two features GitHub exposes a
  public per-repository API for are checked.
- **Releases / Tagging**: repositories that have gone too long without a release
  or tag. Repositories younger than a configurable age are excluded (0 = none
  excluded); specific repositories can also be excluded on demand. Releases and
  tags are reported in separate columns and the rows are ranked by release/tag
  staleness alone (repository age only gates scope): a missing release or tag
  counts as the worst possible signal, so a repo with neither ranks first. The
  ranking key itself is never displayed.
