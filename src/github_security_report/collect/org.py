"""Org-mode orchestration: sweep, gate, probe, classify, aggregate.

Ties the transport (:mod:`client`), scoping (:mod:`scope`), classification
(:mod:`classify`) and aggregation (:mod:`report`) together for a single
organisation, following the Phase 0 strategy: one org-bulk sweep per signal,
then bounded per-repo enabled-probes.

:func:`collect_org` reads as a pipeline of named phases, each implemented by a
helper in this module:

1. :func:`_resolve_scope` -- list the organisation's repositories and scope them
2. :func:`_run_sweeps` -- one org-bulk read per signal, plus ruleset coverage
3. :func:`_gate_signals` -- decide which workflow-driven signals to collect
4. :func:`_build_context` -- freeze the org-wide evidence per-repo probes need
5. :func:`_collect_facts` -- bounded per-repo probes, then classification
6. :mod:`collect.extras` -- the tables outside the four-state signal model

    (``report.graph_batch``), folding the former per-repo Dependabot-enabled,
    latest-release, latest-tag and ``dependabot.yml`` round-trips into a
    handful of requests.

    The batch size adapts downwards. GitHub bounds GraphQL execution per query
    and reports a breach as a gateway timeout (502/504), a 200 with no
    ``data``, or a 200 whose ``errors`` say the query's resource limits were
    exceeded, so a query can fail purely because of how many repositories it
    carries; the same repositories then read fine in two smaller queries. When
    a batch fails that way after the transport's own retries, it is re-queued
    at half the size and every later batch of this organisation uses the
    smaller size too: a slow day at GitHub is a property of the collection,
    not of the one batch that happened to hit it first. The learned size is
    deliberately scoped to the organisation rather than carried across a
    multi-org run -- each organisation collects with its own client and may
    configure its own ``graph_batch``, and organisations differ in how much
    data a repository carries -- at the bounded cost of one oversized batch
    (plus its retries) per organisation on a bad day. A failure that a
    smaller query could not fix (a permission error, an exhausted rate limit,
    a 500/503 outage) propagates unchanged, as does a single-repository query
    that still fails: at that point the API is genuinely unusable and aborting
    beats fabricating "never released" for the repository. The client makes
    that call (see :func:`client.batch_errors._batch_response`); this loop
