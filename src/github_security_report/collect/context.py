"""Org-level context shared by every per-repository probe.

The org-mode pipeline gathers a body of organisation-wide evidence up front
(bulk alert sweeps, ruleset coverage, feature-gating decisions, a batched
GraphQL prefetch) and then walks the repositories, combining that evidence with
a small number of per-repo reads. :class:`OrgCollectContext` freezes the shared
half of that pair, so the per-repo helpers take ``(repo, ctx)`` instead of a
long and steadily-growing positional parameter list.
