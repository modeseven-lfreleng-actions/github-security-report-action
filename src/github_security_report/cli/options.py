    CLI overrides win over config; an unset override (``None``) leaves the

    concrete default for exactly the reason ``--token-env`` needed the same
    treatment: an eager default cannot be told apart from an unset one, so it
    could never be applied as an override.

    The three booleans are one-way. ``--no-gating`` can switch gating off but
    not on, and ``--include-archived`` / ``--include-test`` can widen the scope
    but not narrow it, so a flag can loosen what the configuration asked for
    without being able to tighten it behind the operator's back.

    ``graph_batch`` is an operational lever rather than report policy: it
    changes how the GraphQL prefetch is issued, never what the report says, so
    it may move in either direction.

        ``releases_exclude`` is not scalar: it is a curated per-organisation
        list, and one flag replacing all of them loses data the config
