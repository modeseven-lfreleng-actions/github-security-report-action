"""Boundary checks and dispatch shared by the commands.

The rejections a command performs before it does any work, plus the two pieces
of dispatch both run modes need. Kept apart from :mod:`cli.app` so the command
bodies there stay a readable sequence of named steps rather than the checks
themselves.

Every function here either returns a resolved value or exits. Each rejection
exists because the alternative is a flag that was accepted, validated and then
silently ignored, which leaves the caller no signal that the run did something
other than what they asked for.
