"""Organisation feature gating for the workflow-driven signals.

The Scorecard, zizmor and aislop signals only produce data when an
organisation has deployed supporting workflows (a daily org-wide scan that
uploads SARIF to code scanning, a PR ruleset requiring the scan workflow, or --
for Scorecard -- a per-repository reusable workflow; see
``docs/org-scan-setup.md``). An organisation without that infrastructure would
otherwise see every repository nagged as "not enabled" plus a per-repo probe
spent on a tool that can never be found.

This module performs a cheap, layered support check per gated signal before
any per-repo telemetry is gathered:

1. **Alert evidence** (free): the already-fetched org-bulk code-scanning sweep
   contains at least one alert from the tool.
2. **Ruleset evidence** (free): an already-fetched active org ruleset requires
   a workflow whose path matches the signal's configured keyword.
3. **Sampled analyses** (bounded): the code-scanning analyses endpoint of up to
   ``SAMPLE_SIZE`` repositories is probed for the tool (one filtered request
   per repo). For Scorecard the external scorecard.dev API is sampled too,
   since publish-enabled orgs have scores without code-scanning uploads.

A signal with no evidence at any layer is *skipped*: it is not probed, not
classified, and its report section carries a single
"Skipping feature: organisation support missing" line with a pointer to the
setup guide -- instead of noisy nag lists or failed-query output. The check is
evidence-based, so a brand-new deployment (before the first SARIF upload
lands) may be skipped for one run; ``report.gating: false`` disables gating
entirely for such cases.

CodeQL, Dependabot and secret scanning are GitHub-native features probed via
first-party APIs, so they are never gated.
