"""Org repository-ruleset coverage for workflow-driven tools.

Some tools (e.g. zizmor) are not enabled per-repository; they are enforced
across the estate by an **organisation repository ruleset** containing a
``workflows`` rule that requires a central workflow on every pull request. Such
a repo runs the tool even though it has no matching ``.github/workflows`` file
of its own, so the per-repo enabled-probe would wrongly nag it.

This module reads the authoritative ruleset definitions and computes, for a
given repository, which signals are covered. A signal is mapped to a ruleset by
a case-insensitive keyword match against the required-workflow path (e.g. the
``zizmor`` signal matches ``.github/workflows/zizmor.yaml``). See the
``GET /orgs/{org}/rulesets`` and ``GET /repos/{o}/{r}/rules/branches/{branch}``
GitHub APIs.
