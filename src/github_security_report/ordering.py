"""Configured row ordering for the generic (non-signal) report tables.

Each table builder ships a sensible default ordering -- largest backlog first,
stalest release first, and so on -- and several rank on values that are never
displayed as columns. ``report.categories.<key>.sort`` lets an operator override
that with a list of column names, evaluated left to right:

.. code-block:: json

    {"sort": ["untriaged", "-total", "+repository"]}

A bare name takes the direction implied by its type: numeric columns descend
(most first, which is also oldest-first for an age column) and text columns
ascend. A leading ``-`` forces descending and ``+`` forces ascending. The
repository name is always applied as the final tiebreaker, so two rows that are
equal under every configured term still order deterministically.

The ordering is applied once, when the report is assembled, rather than per
render surface: unlike a row limit, which legitimately differs between the
terminal and a Slack digest, a table's ordering is a property of the table and
must read the same everywhere -- including in ``report.json``.

The severity signal tables (CodeQL, Scorecard, zizmor, aislop, Dependabot
alerts, secret scanning) honour the same configuration key, but resolve their
terms against a **fixed domain vocabulary** rather than a column list -- see
:func:`signal_sort_columns`. Their rows are :class:`models.RepoSignal` objects
whose rendered columns vary by surface and by data (Slack abbreviates the
headers and drops Total, and the Informational column appears only when
populated), so resolving against a renderer's column list would make the
ordering depend on which surface asked. Omitting ``sort`` keeps
:func:`ranking.rank_offenders`, whose default encodes domain logic a column sort
cannot express -- notably Scorecard's cascade through the worst populated
severity rung, which stops a lone Critical being buried by a weaker repository
with a lower score.
