    Dependabot stops raising pull requests once a repository reaches its
    open-pull-request limit, so the repository quietly stops receiving
    dependency updates. That makes a large automation backlog an outage in
    waiting rather than a tidiness problem, so it is flagged before it arrives:
    warning *above* the warn threshold, error *at or above* the error one.

    The thresholds are the operator's policy; the defaults track GitHub's own
    limit of 5. ``value`` counts every automation author rather than Dependabot
    alone, and GitHub applies its limit per package ecosystem, so the colour is
    a prompt to look at a backlog worth looking at, not a verdict that
    Dependabot is stalled.

    Either threshold of ``0`` turns that level off, matching the ``0 = no
    limit`` idiom the row limits already use.

    lets the eye land on the rows that have something wrong with them.

    The trailing Total is never emphasised: it is the sum of columns that
    disagree about what good looks like, so no one colour is true of it.

    The blocked columns are not all one severity. Conflict, Fail and Review are
    red: each needs a person to do something before the pull request can move.
