# a failing check may only need a re-run, a reviewer who requested changes needs
# the author to act, unresolved Copilot feedback needs somebody but does not
# hold the merge button down, and a draft is not blocked at all.
#
# Review sits beside Copilot because the two answer the same question about
# different reviewers, and both sit inside the blocker group rather than beside
# Human -- which names who *raised* a pull request, not who reviewed it. The
# grouping is what keeps those two readings of "human" apart.
