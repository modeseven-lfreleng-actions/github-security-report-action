"""Repository scoping and exclusions.

Default in-scope set: non-archived, non-fork, non-template source repos. Test
repositories are excluded by **token-delimited** matching (a ``test``/``tests``
segment after splitting on ``-_./``), never a raw substring -- so ``latest``,
``attestation`` and ``contest`` are not dropped. Archived and test repos never
appear in nag lists. Every exclusion is logged with its reason so nothing is
dropped silently. See ``docs/BRIEF.md`` section 7.
