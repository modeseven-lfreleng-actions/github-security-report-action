"""Report aggregation.

Groups classified :class:`RepoSignal` results into the renderable report
structure: one section per signal, each with ranked offenders (full list -- the
top-N limit applies only to Slack), a clean count, a nag list (archived/test
repos excluded), and an unknown count. See ``docs/BRIEF.md`` sections 4-6, 11.

The implementation is split across ``signals`` (the four-state
:class:`SignalSection` and the skipped-section wording), ``tables`` (the
generic :class:`TableRow`/:class:`TableSection` model and its cell emphasis
levels), ``aggregate`` (:class:`OrgReport`, :class:`Report` and the builder
that assembles them) and ``display`` (the row limits, totals and footer rows
every render surface shares). This module re-exports the whole surface, so
importing from ``github_security_report.report`` is unchanged.
