"""Aggregation of classified signals into the renderable report structure.

Groups a flat list of classified :class:`RepoSignal` results into one
:class:`SignalSection` per signal, and holds the per-organisation and
whole-run documents those sections hang from -- including the extra
:class:`TableSection` tables (Dependabot posture, releases, issues, pull
requests) collected alongside them.
